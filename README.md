# Introduction 

The main challenge addressed by this project is to implement an e-commerce software solutionthat will facilitate the transition from a 
push supply chain strategy to a pull one for ERIC’s official merchandise which are usually purchased by clubs and members around Europe for
various reasons such as: events, campaigns or PR.

Currently, ERIC depicted the situation as one which leaves them the only option of building stocks of products in anticipation of
members requesting them by email or phone which is unreliable, expensive and requires a lot of storage space. Besides the fundamental objective, 
the implementation of such system also aimed to offer additional functionality that will provide new opportunities for the board of
Rotaract Europe and were not necessarily required by the stakeholders such as: management features for administrators, a personalized interface 
or the idea to integrate donations for various programs that Rotaract currently has or might develop in the future.

ERIC stands for The European Rotaract Information Center is the actual Board that coordinates the activity of Rotaract Europe which is an
international non-profit organization that activates in 47 European countries with a total of 116 districts and more than 20000 members. 
The organization aims to offer its members a platform through which they can develop leadership and cooperation
skills by working on actions and events with impact on communities – both locally and internationally.
